This set of projects facilitates the translation of a rando ROM to Korean, using the Hangul alphabet.

This was an exploratory project. I'm planning to develop an application that facilitates translations in general.

Note that the codebase is a mess, and largely undocumented. Feel free to ask questions by submitting an issue.
