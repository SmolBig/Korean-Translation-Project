This is a work-in-progress project that tinkers with the string table in a rando ROM.

This particular application centers on a translation to Korean, using the Hangul alphabet.

Eventually this will evolve into an application that facilitates translations in general.

Note that the codebase is currently a mess, and largely undocumented, as the project is still in its exploratory phase.
